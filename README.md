BUG Module - README
<!-- This README is intentionally minimal, providing a placeholder structure for the BUG project. Fill in each section as the design and implementation evolve. -->

Overview:

Short description of the BUG module’s purpose and high-level goals. For instance:

“The BUG Module is a versatile, low-power device intended for real-time monitoring, wireless connectivity, and safety shutoff in robotics or embedded systems.”

Features (Planned)
Voltage/Current Measurement: ~20V / 20A capability
IMU (9-Axis): Accelerometer, Gyro, Magnetometer
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth: Connectivity for remote monitoring and control
I2C Expansion: Support for additional sensors
Safety Shutoff: Configurable thresholds for voltage/current
Project Status
Currently in the conceptual/design phase. No hardware or firmware is finalized yet.

Getting Started
To be updated once initial hardware and firmware designs exist.

Usage
Placeholder for instructions or examples showing how to use the BUG module’s features.

Hardware & Firmware
Placeholder sections for PCB design files, schematics, and firmware code details.

Hardware
Schematics (coming soon)
PCB Layout (coming soon)
Firmware
Instructions for building/flashing (coming soon)
Dependencies (coming soon)
Roadmap
Initial Schematic & PCB Layout (underway)
Prototype Assembly (planned)
Firmware Skeleton (planned)
Testing & Validation (planned)
Contributing
We welcome ideas and feedback!

Contribution guidelines will be added once the initial repository structure is in place.

License
License details to be determined.

Note: This template is a placeholder. As the project matures, fill in each section with the actual design details, instructions, and contribution guidelines so others can collaborate effectively.
